# house-sales-prediction
In this project, we first analyze the data set "house_sales_prediction" 
and then perform the data preprocessing steps, which include (clearing the data, checking the redundancy at object and attributes and fixing it, reducing the objects, and normalizing the data), 
then the algorithms We evaluate clustering (K-means and DBSCan) with the supervised and unsupervised method, and then the machine learning classification algorithms on which we apply (MLP, SVM, KNN, MLP + SVM, MLP + KNN, Bayes, DT, Ensemble ), 
and finally, we obtain the frequent patterns and association rules with correlation criterion.
